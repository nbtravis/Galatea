Galatea
=======

Still very much under development, with cool things to come.

You can attach to a GUI (e.g. gogui) using the main class galatea.core.GTP (i.e. java -cp path/to/Galatea/bin galatea.core.GTP). 
Also, you can tweak the time-per-move in that same class (it will be the second arg to engine.getMove).

If you have any questions or want to join in on the project, email me at nathaniel AT cmu DOT edu.
