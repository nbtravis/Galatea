Galatea
=======

Go AI I built in college. Plays somewhat competently in the early/mid game in 9x9, but often makes some silly mistakes. Likely there are some bugs (this was one of my first big programming projects).

**How to Play**

You can attach to a GUI (e.g. gogui) using the main class galatea.core.GTP (i.e. java -cp path/to/Galatea/bin galatea.core.GTP). 
Also, you can tweak the time-per-move in that same class (it will be the second arg to engine.getMove).

*Classes in galatea.util borrowed from javatechniques.com/blog.
